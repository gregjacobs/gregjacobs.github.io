    Hello, my name is Gregory Jacobs. I am a software engineer with 
    <script>document.write(Math.floor(((new Date()).valueOf() - new Date(2000, 6, 1).valueOf())/1000/60/60/24/365));</script>
    years of experience in web application development. 
</p>

<p>I mainly specialize in developing rich, front end applications using modern front-end libraries such as React along with the architecture/patterns to design efficient and maintainable front-end systems.</p>

<p>In my career I've been both a full stack engineer (ColdFusion / Java / PHP / ASP / MSSQL on the backend), and fully-dedicated frontend engineer. In addition to working extensively with React and Angular on the front-end, I've also worked with many past front-end libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, ExtJS, jQuery, and YUI.</p>

<p>I have also had a large focus on and have deep knowledge of: JavaScript build tooling, CI pipelines, test tools, effective testing patterns, codemods, monorepos + scaling for large projects, and many other areas of Web, Node.js, and other development. In addition, I enjoy contributing to Java, Go, and other projects when the opportunities arise.</p>

    I mainly specialize in developing
    rich, front end applications using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and ExtJS / AngularJS /
    jQuery, but I have also done heavy backend work using ColdFusion, PHP, Java, and
    Microsoft SQL Server. I am an expert in JavaScript, and besides ExtJS and jQuery,
    I am also highly proficient with other front end libraries / frameworks such as
    YUI and jQuery UI. I also write plugins, components, and custom frameworks as
    well.
</p>

<p>
    Programming in general, and good software design/architecture is a passion of
    mine, and while OO JavaScript library development is my current affection, I
    also enjoy programming in and have experience using other languages such as Java,
    C++, and C#. I also enjoy database development using SQL Server, and have worked
    with other DBMS's such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
