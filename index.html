    Hello, my name is Gregory Jacobs. I am a software engineer with 15 years of
    experience in web application development. I mainly specialize in developing
    rich, front end applications using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and ExtJS / AngularJS /
    jQuery, but I have also done heavy backend work using ColdFusion, PHP, Java, and
    Microsoft SQL Server. I am an expert in JavaScript, and besides ExtJS and jQuery,
    I am also highly proficient with other front end libraries / frameworks such as
    YUI and jQuery UI. I also write plugins, components, and custom frameworks as
    well.
</p>

<p>
    Programming in general, and good software design/architecture is a passion of
    mine, and while OO JavaScript library development is my current affection, I
    also enjoy programming in and have experience using other languages such as Java,
    C++, and C#. I also enjoy database development using SQL Server, and have worked
    with other DBMS's such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
