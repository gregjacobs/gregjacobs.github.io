<p>
Greetings, I'm Gregory Jacobs, a seasoned software engineer with 
<script>document.write(Math.floor(((new Date()).valueOf() - new Date(2000, 6, 1).valueOf())/1000/60/60/24/365));</script> years of expertise in crafting cutting-edge web applications. 
</p>

<p>
My forte lies in crafting dynamic front-end solutions, leveraging contemporary libraries like React, and implementing robust architecture and patterns to ensure the efficiency and longevity of front-end systems.
</p>

<p>
Throughout my career, I've donned various hats, transitioning seamlessly between full-stack engineering (utilizing technologies such as ColdFusion, Java, PHP, ASP, and MSSQL on the backend) and specializing exclusively in front-end development. While my primary focus revolves around React and Angular, I've honed my skills across a spectrum of front-end libraries and frameworks, including AngularJS, ExtJS, jQuery, and YUI.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, my expertise extends beyond front-end development; I possess in-depth knowledge of JavaScript build tooling, CI pipelines, testing methodologies, codemods, and monorepo management, ensuring seamless scalability for large-scale projects. I'm passionate about contributing to the broader development community, eagerly lending my expertise to projects in Java, Go, and beyond whenever the opportunity arises.

    Hello, my name is Gregory Jacobs. I am a software engineer with 
    <script>document.write(Math.floor(((new Date()).valueOf() - new Date(2000, 6, 1).valueOf())/1000/60/60/24/365));</script>
    years of experience in web application development. I mainly specialize in developing rich, front-end applications using modern front-end libraries such as React along with the architecture/patterns to design efficient and maintainable front-end systems.</p>

<p>In my career I've been both a full stack engineer (ColdFusion / Java / PHP / ASP / MSSQL on the backend), and fully-dedicated frontend engineer. In addition to working extensively with React and Angular on the front-end, I've also worked with many past front-end libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS, ExtJS, jQuery, and YUI.</p>

<p>I have also had a large focus on and have deep knowledge of: JavaScript build tooling, CI pipelines, test tools, effective testing patterns, codemods, monorepos + scaling for large projects, and many other areas of Web, Node.js, and other development. In addition, I enjoy contributing to Java, Go, and other projects when the opportunities arise.</p>

<p>
    I mainly specialize in developing
    rich, front end applications using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and ExtJS / AngularJS /
    jQuery, but I have also done heavy backend work using ColdFusion, PHP, Java, and
    Microsoft SQL Server. I am an expert in JavaScript, and besides ExtJS and jQuery,
    I am also highly proficient with other front end libraries / frameworks such as
    YUI and jQuery UI. I also write plugins, components, and custom frameworks as
    well.
</p>

<p>
    Programming in general, and good software design/architecture is a passion of
    mine, and while OO JavaScript library development is my current affection, I
    also enjoy programming in and have experience using other languages such as Java,
    C++, and C#. I also enjoy database development using SQL Server, and have worked
    with other DBMS's such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
